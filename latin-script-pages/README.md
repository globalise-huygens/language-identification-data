These are the main results from the [language detection](https://github.com/knaw-huc/globalise-tools/tree/main/pipelines/langdetect) pipeline:

* `pages.lang.tsv` - Language classification per page

Derived results with text for inspection:

* `nondutch-pages.lang.tsv` - All pages that have been classified as non-dutch exclusively
* `mixed-pages.lang.tsv` - All pages that have been classified as non-dutch wholly or in part (may be mixed with dutch)
* `unknown-pages.lang.tsv` - All pages classified as unknown
